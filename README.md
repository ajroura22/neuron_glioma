# Abstract
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM, WHO Grade 4) is a highly aggressive primary brain tumor with limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. A key challenge in GBM therapy lies in its pronounced heterogeneity, both within individual tumors (intratumoral) and between patients (intertumoral). Historically, neurons have been underexplored in GBM research; however, recent studies reveal that GBM development is closely linked to neural and glial progenitors, often mimicking neurodevelopmental processes in a dysregulated manner. Beyond damaging neuronal tissue, GBM actively engages with neurons to promote pro-tumorigenic signaling, including neuronal hyperexcitability and seizures. Single-cell RNA sequencing has revolutionized our understanding of the tumor microenvironment (TME), uncovering the critical roles of immune cells, endothelial cells, and astrocytes in tumor progression. However, technical limitations of scRNA-seq hinder its ability to capture the transcriptomes of neurons, necessitating the use of single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to study these interactions at single-cell resolution. This work collects the emerging insights of glioblastoma-neuron interactions, focusing on how GBM exploits neurodevelopmental pathways and reshapes neuronal networks. Moreover, we perform bioinformatic analysis of publicly available snRNA-seq datasets to propose putative cell-cell interactions driving glioma-neuronal dynamics. This study delineates key signaling pathways and underscores the need for further investigation to evaluate their potential as therapeutic targets.
